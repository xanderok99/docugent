# 🚀 Docugent

**Making documentation interactive and accessible for developers everywhere.**

Docugent is an AI-powered documentation assistant that transforms static documentation into interactive, conversational experiences. When developers face errors or need guidance, they can simply chat with Docugent to get exactly what they need - examples, best practices, and even the ability to test ideas in temporary containers.

## 🌟 Vision

**The Problem**: Documentation is often overwhelming, static, and doesn't adapt to individual developer needs. When developers face errors or need guidance, they spend valuable time sifting through pages of documentation.

**The Solution**: Docugent makes documentation conversational, contextual, and actionable. Developers can ask questions in natural language and get precise, relevant answers with examples and best practices.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Google API Key (for AI capabilities)

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd docugent

# Set up environment
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Start the application
docker-compose up --build
```

Access the application at `http://localhost:2025`

### Option 2: Local Development

```bash
# Backend setup
poetry install
poetry run python main.py

# Frontend setup (in another terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Basic Documentation Query
```
User: "How do I implement authentication in my FastAPI app?"
Docugent: "Here's a step-by-step guide with JWT authentication..."

User: "I'm getting a 500 error when deploying to production"
Docugent: "Let me help you debug this. First, let's check your logs..."
```

### Interactive Development
```
User: "Can you show me how to test this API endpoint?"
Docugent: "I'll create a temporary container with your code and run the tests..."
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Google ADK API key | Yes |
| `GOOGLE_MODEL_NAME` | AI model to use | No |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection | Yes |
| `REDIS_URL` | Redis for caching | No |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Application secret | Yes |

### Documentation Sources

Docugent can work with various documentation sources:
- **Static Files**: Markdown, HTML, PDF
- **APIs**: REST APIs, GraphQL
- **Databases**: Structured documentation data
- **Web Scraping**: Dynamic content extraction

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Backend tests
poetry run pytest

# Frontend tests
cd frontend && npm run lint
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Docker Deployment
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### Production Considerations
- **SSL/TLS**: Configure HTTPS certificates
- **Database**: Use managed PostgreSQL
- **Caching**: Redis for performance
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and logging
- **Scaling**: Load balancer configuration
